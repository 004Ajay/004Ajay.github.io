About 73% of world computer users use Windows as their computerâ€™s operating system([see source](https://gs.statcounter.com/os-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#daily-20240921-20241020)). In this group, 35% of users use Windows 11 ([see source](https://gs.statcounter.com/windows-version-market-share/desktop/worldwide/#monthly-202106-202410)). In this story-like guide, I will explain some useful Windows key shortcuts we can use daily!

<!-- truncate -->

_For your information: I will use **Win** as a short-term for Windows. I am using Win 11 but I believe most of the shortcuts in this story will work on other Windows versions as well._

### A Day in My Life: Starting by booting Windows

Most days, I feel the initial energy as I boot up my computer. The days may be full of simple tasks but if left normal, they will take up a good amount of time â€” browsing, checking emails, opening documents, and switching between apps. We all do these tasks, but to be honest: using a mouse for everything is similar to walking in a race (a satiric approach ðŸ˜„). Iâ€™m a keyboard shortcut enthusiast, see my [Jupyter Notebooks story](https://medium.com/@ajaytshaju/useful-keyboard-shortcuts-in-jupyter-notebook-3d488c1e5d29) and you will understand. So let's start with music.

The first thing I do after booting my laptop is to press **Win + A** to open the **Action Center** and toggle Bluetooth ON to pair my wireless earbuds. To start playing some music, I press **Win + 2** ( Chrome browser, the **second item on my taskbar**), straight to YouTube, play my Malayalam music playlist to give me a push for minimal tasks.

Access apps pinned on the taskbar using _Win + corresponding number_, in the image below, to **access the YouTube** I press **Win + 4**, to access the **WhatsApp Web** I press **Win + 5**, and so on. _Count the app number from 1 after the â€˜Start/Windowsâ€™ Icon._

### Getting started with some tasks

Todayâ€™s first task is to collect, arrange, and move some PDFs to different folders, to get started with this task I need to open the Win File Explorer. We have multiple ways to open the File Explorer:

* Option 1: Press **Win + D** or **Win + M** to **minimize all windows** and then press **Win + 1** to open Explorer from the taskbar.
* Option 2: Use the faster route â€” **Win + E** to **open Explorer directly.**
* Option 3: **Cycle through taskbar apps** using **Win + T**.

With Explorer open, I can make folders using **Ctrl + Shift + N**, locate my PDFs, make a few edits, and rearrange them. Thanks to my trusty shortcuts the whole process is seamless and quick.

_Short Tip: **Win + D** and **Win + M** do the same task of minimizing windows. But when you press **Win + D** it will minimize all the windows, and it restores the same windows to their previous state when you press **Win + D** again. This is different from **Win + M**, which minimizes all windows but doesnâ€™t bring them back with a second press._

While I was editing and rearranging the 13th PDF, my mother asked me to write a letter to someone. She explained the content in our local language Malayalam. To save time, I opened Windows Notepad and pressed **Win + H** to open the **dictation feature** for quick writing without typing. As you may have guessed, I wrote 60% of my medium blogs using this feature. But proofreading was essential to catch any miswritten words or missing details. See the image below.

Though it seems overwhelming to speak, read, and correct mistakes, it is often time-saving and good for fingers than typing. After I completed the letter, I sent the content via WhatsApp.

Before continuing with other works I saw a charge draining problem with my laptop's battery, to inspect it I opened **Windows Settings** using **Win + I** to see the battery performance on System > Power & battery but I didnâ€™t see any problem in the stats shown by my computer. For more scrutiny, I pressed **Win + X** to open the **quick link menu** (same as right-clicking on the start button) opened the terminal in Admin mode, and used the command `powercfg /batteryreport` to generate a detailed report of my battery â€” which shows my battery capacity has dropped from 66Wh to 40Wh in just three years of usage.

Seeing the poor condition of my laptop's battery I felt a need for a short break for my laptop as well as to recharge myself. I pressed **Win + L** to **lock my laptop** and stepped away for a quick stretch and refresh.

### The Next Cycle

I had more things to do, returned to my laptop. The first task is to help one of my friends work with projectors on Windows. I set up a Google Meet and demonstrated it live using **Win + P** to access **Projection Settings**. This shortcut makes switching between modes like Duplicate and Extend easier, I also taught him screen size and resolution adjustments.

Next, I was planning for a small tweak â€” adding the _Open with VS Code_ option to my right-click menu for folders. I press **Win + R** to open the Run dialog box, typed `regedit`, and hit Enter. In the registry editor, I did some customization in no time. And the result was amazing, just click the underlined option in the context menu to open vs code on any folder.

While I was doing a lazy walk through some websites, I found a webinar from an MNC and filled out a webinar registration form. Just like other forms, it consists of many redundant things like name, email, address, pin code, college, etc. I used **Win + V** to access **Clipboard History** and seamlessly pasted all the information as I had copied and pinned it on my clipboard way back.

Now it's time to give you, the reader something. I pressed **Win + ,** (comma) to temporarily **peek at my desktop** to show you my latest minimal name typography wallpaper.

And last but not least, in chats and blogs, emojis convey emotions well. Add emojis while working on Windows laptops using **Win + .** (period), to open the **emoji window** and click to add emoji wherever needed ðŸ˜…ðŸ˜….

_Bonus tip: In the WhatsApp desktop or web app, type `:` (colon) followed by the emoji name (e.g., `:happy`) for faster emoji insertion._

Since most of my works were finished, itâ€™s time to give my laptop a good night's sleep. I pressed a series of shortcuts â€” **Win + D, Win + X, U, S**, where **Win + D** minimizes all windows, **Win + X** opens the quick link menu, **U** for Shut down or sign out, and **S** for Sleep. This is my favorite shortcutðŸ’“.
