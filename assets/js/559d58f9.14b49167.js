There is a lot to be corrected in this, for example \u2014 if you know how to work with HTML and CSS, then delete the div container codes and render a webpage full of credit and debit info without any dividing boxes and just copy the data directly from the webpage and apply some regular expression to remove unwanted information(from ",(0,i.jsx)(t.a,{href:"http://www.medium.com/@ajaytshaju/converting-bank-statements-to-insights-using-google-sheets-for-data-transformation-and-cleanup-58259d102108",children:"Part 1"}),") would be much better than chewing the raw HTML CSS codes. I may return with another blog in the future by solving the current processes(maybe the app that solves my current issues might be under the work of a thinker like you). With that said, Thank you for reading \ud83c\udf89."]})]})}function c(e={}){const{wrapper:t}={...(0,o.R)(),...e.components};return t?(0,i.jsx)(t,{...e,children:(0,i.jsx)(d,{...e})}):d(e)}},7339:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Zap Editor-9021ab33e10b05aa81a54a89068f2391.webp"},28453:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{R:()=>s,x:()=>r});var n=a(96540);const i={},o=n.createContext(i);function s(e){const t=n.useContext(o);return n.useMemo(function(){return"function"==typeof e?e(t):{...t,...e}},[t,e])}function r(e){let t;return t=e.disableParentContext?"function"==typeof e.components?e.components(i):e.components||i:s(e.components),n.createElement(o.Provider,{value:t},e.children)}},43784:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/View of My Minimal Dashboard-73c1ad4d9952c099988f0c800fe8f18d.webp"},47740:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Dropdown selection-random-f1fd050c9634464ac955dafcdb81e077.webp"},48230:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Dropdown selection-one by one-4b3e8ac99d7ebf84a176192c455a5018.webp"},49024:e=>{e.exports=JSON.parse('{"permalink":"/blog/statement-to-insights-part2","source":"@site/blog/2024-11-13-Part_2_Converting_Bank_Statements_to_Insights_Automating_Future_Data_Collection_using_Gmail_Zapier_and_Google_Sheets/story.md","title":"Converting Bank Statements to Insights: Automating Future Data Collection using Gmail Zapier and Google Sheets Part 2","description":"Read on Medium","date":"2024-11-13T00:00:00.000Z","tags":[{"inline":false,"label":"Python","permalink":"/blog/tags/python","description":"Python tag description"},{"inline":false,"label":"Automation","permalink":"/blog/tags/automation","description":"Automation tag description"}],"readingTime":12.99,"hasTruncateMarker":true,"authors":[{"name":"Ajay T Shaju","title":"AI & DS Engineer","url":"https://004ajay.github.io/","page":{"permalink":"/blog/authors/ajay"},"socials":{"linkedin":"https://www.linkedin.com/in/ajay-t-shaju/","github":"https://github.com/004ajay","medium":"https://medium.com/@ajaytshaju","x":"https://x.com/004ajayt"},"imageURL":"https://github.com/004ajay.png","key":"ajay"}],"frontMatter":{"slug":"statement-to-insights-part2","title":"Converting Bank Statements to Insights: Automating Future Data Collection using Gmail Zapier and Google Sheets Part 2","authors":["ajay"],"tags":["python","automation"]},"unlisted":false,"prevItem":{"title":"Must Know Windows Key Shortcuts for Your Daily Tasks: A Story like Guide","permalink":"/blog/windows-key-shortcuts"},"nextItem":{"title":"Converting Bank Statements to Insights: Automating Future Data Collection using Gmail Zapier and Google Sheets Part 1","permalink":"/blog/statement-to-insights-part1"}}')},49421:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/XLOOKUP Formula-38cef0e7bfdd9df59957933deda36edf.webp"},54092:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Power of Zapier AI-e90926e24ea72fd3e1d3b505f178de65.webp"},70294:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/The overall process-331838f54bb84bc66383bf60de878b9a.webp"},72298:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Data collected automatically using Zapier-c9462c9695c933b8b5bdb1d75af4a9a2.webp"},80224:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Zapier alert email-029b9367dd7e5650e0ad4bf274ada2db.webp"},81645:(e,t,a)=>{a.d(t,{A:()=>n});const n=a.p+"assets/images/Zapier Interface-ab2a2103d0ea5e7aa35c3e860a28ea14.webp"}}]);
