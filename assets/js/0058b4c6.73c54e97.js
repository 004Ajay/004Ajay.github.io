I love the names of open source technologies, especially the acronyms they use — terminal names like Bash (Bourne Again SHell), Fish, Zsh (Z Shell) are very appropriate to them.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"blogs-public/Building_my_Deep_Learning_project_Emotion2Emoji_Challenges_and_Chuckles/story":{"id":"blogs-public/Building_my_Deep_Learning_project_Emotion2Emoji_Challenges_and_Chuckles/story","title":"story","description":"In the dynamic landscape of technology, innovation becomes a beacon that guides creators to captivate audiences with unique and engaging projects.

Most of us succeed in one way or another. As Malayalam actor Prithviraj Sukumaran once said in an interview, “Getting to a position is easier, but maintaining it is harder”. The same applies to money—earning, whether from a job, investments, real estate, rentals, or even through family support may come relatively easily, but managing it wisely is much more challenging. That’s where financial trackers become essential. They allow us to visually track where our money comes from and where it goes, enabling us to make informed decisions. This blog will guide you in building a simple yet automated personal finance tracker.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"blogs-public/Part_2_Converting_Bank_Statements_to_Insights_Automating_Future_Data_Collection_using_Gmail_Zapier_and_Google_Sheets/story":{"id":"blogs-public/Part_2_Converting_Bank_Statements_to_Insights_Automating_Future_Data_Collection_using_Gmail_Zapier_and_Google_Sheets/story","title":"Converting Bank Statements to Insights: Automating Future Data Collection using Gmail Zapier and Google Sheets Part 2","description":"Before starting Part 2, make sure you catch up on Part 1, where I share the groundwork for transforming raw bank statements — the data collection, Google Sheets and Llama LLM for data cleanup, failed attempts, and learning many valuable techniques — click to read Part 1!","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"blogs-public/Step_by_Step_Guide_for_Creating_a_Reading_Habit_Tracker_in_Google_Sheets/story":{"id":"blogs-public/Step_by_Step_Guide_for_Creating_a_Reading_Habit_Tracker_in_Google_Sheets/story","title":"Step by Step Guide for Creating a Reading Habit Tracker in Google Sheets","description":"Tracking your reading habits is essential to staying consistent and motivated in your reading journey. While many readers prefer using physical notebooks or apps to log their progress, I found a personalized Google Sheet to be the perfect tool as a tracker, because we can heavily customize it, integrate other tools, and access it anywhere on the Earth if you have a device with internet and your Gmail account signed in. In this story, I will walk you through the steps to create a reading habit tracker using Google Sheets and the data I collected over the years.","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"commands/anaconda":{"id":"commands/anaconda","title":"Anaconda","description":"Anaconda / Conda related commands","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"commands/cuDF Pandas":{"id":"commands/cuDF Pandas","title":"cuDF Pandas","description":"Run GPU Accelerated Pandas using cuDF","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"commands/delete files":{"id":"commands/delete files","title":"Deleting Files","description":"Delete huge number of files in minutes/hours","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"commands/Directory Ownership":{"id":"commands/Directory Ownership","title":"Directory Ownership","description":"Change ownership of a directory","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"commands/Docker":{"id":"commands/Docker","title":"Docker","description":"Docker Commands:","sidebar":"tutorialSidebar"},"commands/JSONL":{"id":"commands/JSONL","title":"JSONL","description":"1.
